        <b>Venue</b>: HSB 263 <br>
        <b>Course Outline</b>:  
        Learning objectives This is an intermediate level course in electromagnetic fields and assumes background in electrostatics, magneto-statics and introductory knowledge in electrodynamics. The main objective is to introduce electromagnetic fields with emphasis on analytical rigour and physical reasoning required for solving problems having direct application. The course will also provide sufficient background to motivate students to take up advanced levels courses such as, electromagnetic scattering, computational electrodynamics, etc. Learning outcomes Upon successful completion, the students will have learned i) the importance of constitutive properties of materials and their use in applications, ii) the effect of boundaries and be able to develop and analyze optical coatings, iii) time dependent formulation of potentials and fields, and fields dues to moving charges, iv) the fundamental ideas in electromagnetic scattering with relevance to applications and v) the concept of waveguides and propagation of guided electromagnetic waves. <br>
