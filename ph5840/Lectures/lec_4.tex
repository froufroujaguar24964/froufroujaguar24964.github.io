Just before the measurement, what was the value of observable \(\hat{A} = \sum\limits_{i} \ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i} \).
\begin{answer}
    \textbf{Copenhagen Interpretation}
    The particle doesn't have a position before measurement.   
\end{answer}

On the elements of reality.\\
"If, without in anyway disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (with p = 1) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality.
corresponding to the physical quantity."
